//A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.
//expect multiplication(5, 2) to be 10
//except multiplcations(2, 3) to be 6
//except multiplcations ("a", 3) to be an error / testing  unexpected input

//expect multiplication (-3, 4) to be 12
//Expect multiplication(0, 3) to be equal to 0 // testing multiplication by zero

//A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.
//expect concatOdds() to be error
//expect concatOdds(['hello', 'world', 'two', '4', 9], [null]) to be error
//expect concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) the result is [-1, 1, 3, 9, 15]
//expect concatOdds(['three', 2, 1], [a, 1, 1, 1, b, 15, -1]) to be error

//Functional Tests: A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account),
//or as a logged-in user. They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest.
